# Turkish Video Player

> A flexible HTML5/JS video player for simultaneous playback of multiple videos in a customizable grid with a marquee and logo.

## Overview

**Turkish Video Player** is a flexible **HTML5/JS video player** designed for simultaneous playback of multiple video files in a customizable grid (multi-video grid). The player is controlled via a simple **JSON config**, allowing for easy modification of the layout, appearance, and behavior without editing the code. The project is ideal for local execution directly from a folder in a browser and can be easily adapted for websites and online installations.

## Use Cases

This project is useful for anyone looking for a flexible and customizable solution to display multiple videos simultaneously, for example, for:
*   **Interactive Installations:** Demonstrating various video materials in exhibition spaces.
*   **Digital Signage:** Displaying promotional or informational videos on a single screen.
*   **Educational Purposes:** Playing educational videos in parallel.
*   **Entertainment Platforms:** Creating unique video collages or multi-screen presentations.
*   **Testing and Debugging Video Content:** Viewing multiple versions of a video at the same time.

## Tech Stack

The project is built on standard web technologies, requiring no external libraries or frameworks.

*   **HTML5:** For structure and video embedding (`<video>`).
*   **CSS3:** For styling the grid, logo, marquee, and creating a responsive design.
*   **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** For player logic, configuration loading, and dynamic style application.
*   **JSON:** For storing all player settings and configurations.

## Quick Start

1.  **Gather Files:** Place all the files you plan to use (videos, logo) in the same folder as `index.html` (or `index.ru.html` if you are Russian).
2.  **Run the Player:** Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
3.  **Configure:** Select files and customize the player's styles. Settings can be saved to a `settings.json` file for quick restoration later.

## Configuration Examples

The repository includes examples of video and image files, as well as JSON configuration files (`settings.json`, `bw_landscape.json`, `blue_rounded_grid.json`), demonstrating various preset styles and settings. Use the "Load Settings" button to quickly switch between saved configurations.
